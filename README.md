# activity-feed-pusher-react
This application shows how to integrate Pusher with a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend and React in the front-end.

You can follow the [tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/activity-feed-react/) to build this application or jump straight to the code.

## Getting Started
1. Create an app on Pusher and copy your app's id, key, and secret.
2. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
3. Start the MongoDB server
4. Execute `npm install` to download dependencies.
5. Execute
PUSHER_APP_ID=544656 PUSHER_APP_KEY=a23ec57766308fc4aa52 PUSHER_APP_SECRET=4ed610788e906066e543 node --inspect-brk server.js 
to set the environment variables needed by the app with your Pusher info and start it.
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and start sending playing with the app using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to communicate with the API or the Pusher console to test only the front-end part.
